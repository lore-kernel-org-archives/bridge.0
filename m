> This set makes the bridge dump host-joined mdb entries, they should be
> treated as normal entries since they take a slot and are aging out.
> We already have notifications for them but we couldn't dump them until
> now so they remained hidden. We dump them similar to how they're
> notified, in order to keep user-space compatibility with the dumped
> objects (e.g. iproute2 dumps mdbs in a format which can be fed into
> add/del commands) we allow host-joined groups also to be added/deleted via
> mdb commands. That can later be used for L2 mcast MAC manipulation as
> was recently discussed. Note that iproute2 changes are not necessary,
> this set will work with the current user-space mdb code.
> 
> Patch 01 - a trivial comment move
> Patch 02 - factors out the mdb filling code so it can be
>            re-used for the host-joined entries
> Patch 03 - dumps host-joined entries
> Patch 04 - allows manipulation of host-joined entries via standard mdb
>            calls
> 
> v3: fix compiler warning in patch 04 (DaveM)
> v2: change patch 04 to avoid double notification and improve host group
>     manual removal if no ports are present in the group

Series applied.
