> This set adds the first per-vlan option - state, which uses the new vlan
> infrastructure that was recently added. It gives us forwarding control on
> per-vlan basis. The first 3 patches prepare the vlan code to support option
> dumping and modification. We still compress vlan ranges which have equal
> options, each new option will have to add its own equality check to
> br_vlan_opts_eq(). The vlans are created in forwarding state by default to
> be backwards compatible and vlan state is considered only when the port
> state is forwarding (more info in patch 4).
> I'll send the selftest for the vlan state with the iproute2 patch-set.
> 
> v2: patch 3: do full (all-vlan) notification only on vlan
>     create/delete, otherwise use the per-vlan notifications only,
>     rework how option change ranges are detected, add more verbose error
>     messages when setting options and add checks if a vlan should be used.

Series applied, thanks.
